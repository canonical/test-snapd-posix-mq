summary: Snap for testing the posix-mq snap interface
description: |
    The posix-mq snap interface allows access to POSIX message queue interface as
    described by the mq_overview(7) manual page. The snap contains a number of
    applications that all call into the mqctl binary, each with a different set
    of permissions resulting from connected snap interface plugs.
